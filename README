COMPILER:  Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn)


UPDATE: 9-22
Testing was mostly successful with a few minor modifications.
main.cpp updated to reflect tests.
dynamic nodes handled more efficiently


Included are Class definition and implementations for two classes:

Point:
-has two private variables
    -dim, an int that holds the number of dimensions
    -*pArray, a pointer to a list of double values
-all operators are overwritten
-has accessor and mutator functions for the two private variables

AND

Cluster:
-has two private variables
    -size, an int that holds the size of the cluster
    -points, a pointer to a Struct object
        -Above Struct object has two members and collectively forms a singly-linked list:
            -p, a pointer to a Point object
            -next, a pointer to an LNode, or the next struct object in the SLL
-all operators are overwritten
-has accessor functions for private variables



DRAWBACKS:
-I believe that some of my overwritten operators mishandle pointers and produce erroneous Clusters.
-I did not finish in time to test all of the code, so it certainly has errors.
-No comments (SORRY!!!!)
